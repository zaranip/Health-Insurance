##Data Preparation
Import data and remove missing rows.
```{r}
insurance <- read.csv("insurance.csv")
insurance <- na.omit(insurance)
```

##Linear Regression Models

```{r}
mod<-lm(charges~., data=insurance)
summary(mod)
```
Using only statistically significant factors: age, bmi, children, smoker (yes).
```{r}
sigFac<-lm(charges~age + bmi + children + smoker, data=insurance)
summary(sigFac)
```
##Residual Plots
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
hist(sigFac$residuals, prob = TRUE)
lines(density(sigFac$residuals))

qqnorm(y=sigFac$residuals)
qqline(y=sigFac$residuals, datax = FALSE)
```
##Testing Correlation With Clustering
Our previous model stated that age, bmi, children, smoker (yes) were all significant factors. We are now going to perform a clustering model to see if this still holds true.

```{r}
seed.val<-1234



```
