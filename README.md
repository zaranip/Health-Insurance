Name: Predicting Health Insurance Costs in the United States Using Patient Medical History

Zara Nip and Nehal Linganur

We will be asking the following questions: which factors impact an individual’s health insurance premium the most? Least? We want to understand the different factors behind health insurance companies’ decision-making processes and generate some reasons why those biases might happen. If time allows, we may also compare our results to different countries or explore more specifically within a few key groups. Our domain spans finance, because of the insurance component; healthcare; and demographics, including sex, age, and number of children.

We will use data from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance) and there are also alternative sources of data like (https://data.world/datasets/insurance).
